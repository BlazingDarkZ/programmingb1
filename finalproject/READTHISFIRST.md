Dear Kai,

I would like to thank you first and foremost for this semester. It was a very fun experience both learning Python and about you. Wishing you
the best corporate career ahead, but if you ever have a want for a change, I think teaching would be a good fit. Hope to be learning from you again in the future (hopefully not from this particular module haha)

Here's the breakdown of the final project

Along with the requirements for the FastAPI project, I also added a front-end which could be accessed through
